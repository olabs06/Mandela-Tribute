        <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election.</p>
        <p>Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. After studying law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand, he became a lawyer and joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943. For his anti-apartheid activism, he was arrested and imprisoned for 27 years.</p>
        <p>He was released from prison in 1990 and led negotiations to dismantle apartheid, which led to multi-racial elections in 1994 and his election as president. He focused on dismantling institutionalized racism, poverty, and inequality, and fostering racial reconciliation. Mandela passed away on December 5, 2013.</p>
        <p>Throughout his life, Nelson Mandela inspired people around the world with his message of forgiveness, perseverance, and hope for a better future.</p>
